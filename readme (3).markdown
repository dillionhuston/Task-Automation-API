# Project Plan: Task Automation API Platform

## Project Description
A backend-only FastAPI application enabling users to upload files, schedule automated tasks (e.g., reminders, cleanup jobs), and receive email notifications. Includes secure authentication, admin tools, and Docker-based deployment..

## Features
- **User Authentication**: JWT-based registration and login.
- **File Management**: Upload, list, delete files; validate file integrity with SHA-256 hashing.
- **Task Scheduler**: Schedule and manage background tasks (e.g., reminders, file cleanup).
- **Background Processing**: Execute tasks asynchronously using Celery.
- **Email Notifications**: Send task-related notifications via email.
- **Admin Tools**: CLI and API for administrative tasks (e.g., user management, task monitoring).
- **Deployment**: Containerized deployment with Docker and Docker Compose.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (production), SQLite (development)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with Alembic for migrations
- **Task Queue**: Celery with Redis as message broker
- **Email**: SendGrid (preferred) or smtplib (fallback)
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Testing**: pytest, FastAPI TestClient
- **Security**: python-jose (JWT), passlib (password hashing)
- **Other**: python-multipart (file uploads), python-dotenv (environment variables)

## Timeline (8 Weeks)
Each week includes specific tasks, deliverables, and milestones to guide coding and track progress. Tasks are broken into smaller, actionable steps to make implementation manageable.

### Week 1: Project Setup & Authentication
- **Goals**: Set up project skeleton, configure environment, implement user authentication.
- **Tasks**:
  - Initialize FastAPI project with virtualenv and requirements.txt.
  - Set up .env file and python-dotenv for environment variables (e.g., SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL).
  - Configure FastAPI app in `main.py` with basic health-check endpoint (`/health`).
  - Set up SQLAlchemy with SQLite (dev) and PostgreSQL (prod) in `models.py`.
  - Create user model with fields: `id`, `email`, `hashed_password`, `is_active`, `is_admin`.
  - Implement JWT-based authentication in `auth.py` (login, registration, token refresh).
  - Create Pydantic schemas in `schemas.py` for user requests/responses.
  - Add user endpoints in `routes/users.py` (`/register`, `/login`, `/me`).
  - Set up dependency injection in `dependencies.py` for auth and database sessions.
  - Write basic tests for auth endpoints in `test_auth.py`.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Working user registration and login API.
  - SQLite database with user table.
  - Basic project structure with configuration.
- **Milestone**: Successfully register and login a user, receive a JWT token.

### Week 2: File Management System
- **Goals**: Implement file upload, listing, deletion, and hash validation.

  - Create file model in `models.py` with fields: `id`, `user_id`, `filename`, `hash`, `upload_date`.
  - Add file endpoints in `routes/files.py` (`/upload`, `/list`, `/delete/{file_id}`).
  - Implement file upload logic with python-multipart in `utils/file.py`.
  - Compute and store SHA-256 hash for uploaded files.
  - Restrict file access to authenticated users (user_id foreign key).
  - Store files on disk (e.g., `uploads/` directory) with unique filenames.
  - Add file validation (size limits, allowed extensions).
  - Write tests for file endpoints in `test_files.py`.
- **Deliverables**:
  - API for file upload, list, and deletion.
  - File integrity validation with hashes.
- **Milestone**: Upload a file, verify its hash, list files, and delete a file.

  - Create task model in `models.py` with fields: `id`, `user_id`, `task_type`, `schedule_time`, `status`.
  - Add task endpoints in `routes/tasks.py` (`/schedule`, `/list`, `/cancel/{task_id}`).
  - Implement task scheduling logic in `utils/task.py` (store tasks in database).
  - Support task types: reminders, file cleanup (delete files older than X days).
  - Add input validation for task schedules using Pydantic in `schemas.py`.
